# Ai-Tool_Analysis
## Overview
## This project analyzes AI tool usage trends, performance, and user engagement using SQL. The dataset contains information about AI tools, users, and interactions, including:
✔ AI Tool Names and their performance metrics (queries, response time, ratings).

✔ User Data (unique users, subscription types, and engagement levels).

✔ Usage Patterns across different time periods.

# Problem Statement

As AI adoption grows, organizations need data-driven insights to optimize AI tool performance and user experience. This analysis aims to:
🔹 Identify the most popular AI tools based on queries.

🔹 Find the fastest AI tools using response time data.

🔹 Determine which AI tools attract more users based on engagement metrics.

🔹 Analyze subscription-based usage patterns to improve business strategies.

🔹 Track AI tool usage trends over time for better decision-making.
